# HiddenMarkovModel
Repository of the Summer School project at the ISICNI Imbizo 2022. Big thanks to Spiros Chavalres and all the teacher assistants at the school!


The discreteHMM.py code implemenets a hidden markov model from scratches by training it on syntetic generated data. 
The reconstructed transition and emission probability matrix are compared with the original ones and the ones reconstructed using the hmmlearn python package.
